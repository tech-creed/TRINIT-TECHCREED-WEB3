## Problem Explored
In the digital era, talent discovery and collaboration often face challenges such as lack of transparency, centralized control, and limited opportunities for fair compensation. Traditional platforms rely on intermediaries, resulting in inefficiencies and barriers to entry for talented individuals. Additionally, existing systems may not adequately address privacy concerns, leading to data vulnerabilities and misuse.

## Solution Developed
Introducing a decentralized platform revolutionizing talent discovery and collaboration. Leveraging blockchain technology, We offers transparent, tamper-proof systems for identity management, portfolio showcase, and collaboration agreements. By tokenizing skills and contributions, users can receive fair compensation and incentives, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of collaboration. It empowers individuals to showcase their talents, connect with opportunities, and collaborate seamlessly in a secure, inclusive environment.

Config the metamask in browser with the port 9585
/ ETH Localchain start in the localhost:9585
```
#### 2. NodeJS Server
```
npm install
nodemon app.js
/ Web Server start at localhost:52231
```
#### 3. Smart Contract
```
truffle compaile
truffle migrate
/ The Developed smart contract will be deployed to local ETH chain
Note : Copy the compailed contract inside build and paste inside public folder
```
#### 4. IPFS System Config
```
Gateway : 127.0.0.1:8081
